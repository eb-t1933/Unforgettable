The drunk guy on the dock leading down from the Kings Arms who came up to me and my friends and gave a speech about how we couldn't remember the release of &ldquo;Live Forever&rdquo; and that this was why society would never reach Mars that was so impassioned that he convinced everyone to jump directly into the Ouse for a swim, except for me, because I am no swimmer.
