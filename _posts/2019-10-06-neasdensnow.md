The drifting car's slow gentle arc had the intent of a dream, bringing it around to end with a soft sweeping noise up against the fence out front of the house by the North Circular, where a friend and I had sat up for hours watching cars skidding in the snow as we drank and I smoked, and we cheered now: what we had wanted had happened, and no one had been hurt, and now here was this dent in the fence to remember a stupid night spent in my room ignoring our problems.
