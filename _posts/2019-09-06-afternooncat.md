The side gate to the back garden opened always and only with effort; it had been raining, and as I stepped through to find the front door key hidden in a flower pot I paused and looked across the garden fence and the house behind and the snickets and playing fields of the village and over to the sun that had skirted the clouds and settled in a throne of pink and orange, and tried for the first time in my life to ensure that I wouldn't forget, and in so doing imprinted an ambiguity that by its smudged uncertainty anchored the rest of the scene, created an entropic vortex that rendered all else crystalline: was there a cat, sitting there on the patio storage box, or did I stand there alone and silent?
