The moment of happiness struck in a Boston T station on my way back from getting a new social security card at the appropriate government office, it must have been so I could start work at Legal Sea Foods; it must have been North Station, and I remember it was underground: it must have been on the Green Line platform that happiness struck, and I started dancing to The Books' 'Take Time' and realized my happiness and was able&mdash;incredibly&mdash;to enjoy that, to grow my happiness further, because nothing was wrong.
