title: A stretch of Flatbush Ave

The stretch of Flatbush Ave out beyond Atlantic leading up to the bridge at night during the summer of 2019 as I sped downhill in the rushing wind on a bike avoiding multi-lane traffic, and the spires of the New Brooklyn that has grown from what I'm told was the old one reared up over the horizon like a cat's claw looming, and I realized just how long half a decade is, and just how much it is too long.
