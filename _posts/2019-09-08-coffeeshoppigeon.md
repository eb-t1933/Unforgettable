title: A coffee shop pigeon

The coffee shop pigeon stopped being an unqualified pigeon when it flew through the open door as I was serving someone coffee, avoiding the floor-to-ceiling wall of glass panes along the length of the train station waiting room, hovered over every table in turn long enough to blow the menu off of each, one after the other, as if there were method, then flew back out the narrow opening again unharmed, leaving only the customer saying: 'When they fly inside, they almost never survive.'
