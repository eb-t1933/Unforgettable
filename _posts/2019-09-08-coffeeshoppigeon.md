title: A coffee shop pigeon
---

The door was open and I was serving someone coffee when a pigeon, avoiding the floor-to-ceiling wall of glass panes along the length of the train station waiting room, flew in through the door, hovered over each table in turn long enough to blow the menu off of each, one after the other, as if there were method, then flew back out the narrow opening again unharmed, leaving only the customer saying: 'When they fly inside, they almost never survive.'
