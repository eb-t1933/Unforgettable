The moment and its twin pierced through time, telescoped to each other from beyond those two frontiers, north and south, familiar and feared, cold and loathed, that Europe thinks it sees when it turns in a circle: a fringe of firework light brushed across the flat roofline of a northern village as I leaned out of the window of a car speeding down a B road, trying to tag a car carrying another group of friends and turning my glance briefly to the home that was not-home&mdash;and I saw reflected off the thin invisible gauze of nights spent in a place no longer yours the memory of sticking my head out a train window as we pulled into Istanbul, unexplained fireworks blasting holes between shadows in the trench of the station approach; and I grasped these moments in ways I so dearly wish I could now.
