The meteor shower to my eye was first a single shooting star dragging its splinter through the night sky that now rippled and fluttered, driven by the breath of a world rendered vivid: I had gone, been, come back, didn't you know that I <i>understood</i> elsewheres now&emdash;and I recalled a shooting star on the first day of my journey in Europe, as a crowd crushed me against the rail of a Venetian vaporetto; and then my recollection became some kind of lesson learned as I stopped on the Old Orchard road and stared in wonder as one shooting star became two, three, four, too many: but this isn't what I'm remembering now, but instead later, when I was sat in a room that wasn't my room because it had become my old room, alone in the obscurity of the night, typing into a website's CMS that I had seen a shooting star, once, in Venice: "A long time ago."
