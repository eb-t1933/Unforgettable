title: A room in an empty house

The room in the empty house swaddled me in the hopeless loneliness of a solitary month with no company save a panic disorder that left me crawling on the floors and shaking in the corners and simulating to myself with extreme verisimilitude the experiences of heart attacks, strokes, fainting spells, until: the email that told me that the man with whom I had shared so many clandestine drinks, who fell apart as he spoke with the ghosts of his family in a church, who led me in a t-shirt through the lunar desolation of Piedmontese snowdrifts, who on my birthday sent me a promise that he would kill me&mdash;had returned to his familyâ€™s home and killed himself; I set the computer aside in the dark and stared out into the city's red cataract of a sky and saw there a light: and it drifted at edge-of-perception slowness as I watched it motionlessly for hours, feeling no tiredness, so so slowly, circling and drifting downward in something so close to a pattern it felt nauseating&mdash;the only time in my life that I felt the boundless malevolence of Place. Of London.
