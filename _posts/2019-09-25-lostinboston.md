title: A guy in a parking lot booth
---

The guy in the parking lot booth on an island of streetlight in downtown Boston was my cry-for-help-to-er: totally lost, never having figured out how to get to my hostel save that I thought that it was in some neighborhood called &ldquo;Fenway&rdquo;, I knocked on his door so numbed with pain from the cold that I felt paradoxical heat, and he brought me into the booth where he sat happily between a crowd of electric radiators, real restorative heat; and he pulled out a map, and he showed me the way.
