The forbidden tunnel was the thing of legend at university&mdash;did a subterranean network really run under the faux French chateau built by the chalk-pill-hawking crank?&mdash;but it existed, surfaced behind the campus bar's storeroom, and the hole next to the locked door was just, just large enough for me, 130 lbs at the time, to squeeze through and open the entrance from the inside, where we ran under what we thought were sewer grates, where we hid from the shout of a security guard and I got stuck up a shaft as my friends ran away underneath me and the guard's shouts grew closer; and where, returning another time and penetrating deeper to the end of the tunnel wher it opened out to a cavernous space housing furnaces that loomed tall into lightlessess, and a portacabin there under the vault of some Victorian mechanism of social structure hid, in a side drawer, a planner; a planner that contained the scrawls of a diary; a diary the devolved into suspicions of co-workers, hatred of a sister, curses, threats in the dark.
