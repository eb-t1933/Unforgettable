The break of sunlight opened up as I walked down Gillygate on a day that was one of my last: a golden perfection of invincible youth, unaware of the terrible things I had done and had yet to do, but understanding that my toes rested on a precipice: we all only get to leave, really leave, once, and there is no frantic prayer to whatever filigree-fine network of shining symbols we have painted in our own skies that will set the stage exactly how we want it, there is simply too much life&mdash;but I had this: the sixty domes of Diomira emerging from the now sun-swimming mist of that morning and a sudden, striking understanding that I had already been there and was returning there for the last time as the light faded back towards night, as I came to feel envy towards that other one who believed that he had once before lived an evening identical to this and who thought he was happy, that time.
