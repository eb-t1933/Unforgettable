title: A sunny day on Gillygate
---

The sunny day on Gillygate was one of my last: a golden perfection of invincible youth, unaware of my own sins and terrible things I had yet to do, but understanding that my toes rested on a precipice: we all only get to leave, really leave, once, and there is no frantic prayer to whatever filigree-fine network of shining symbols we have painted in our own skies that will set the stage exactly how we want it, there is simply too much life&mdash;but I had this: the sixty domes of Diomira emerging from the sun-swimming mist of that morning and a sudden, striking understanding of where that place is, but also that I had already been there, and that I would arrive there once again but also for the first time as the light grew dim towards night, when I would come to feel envy towards that other who one believed that he had once before lived an evening identical to this and who thought he was happy, that time.
