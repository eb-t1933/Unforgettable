    <p>The woman with her son walked in the drip-drab of sunlight through the leaves on a summer day that I had chosen for beginning a walk from my old hometown all the way to Canterbury cathedral along what I had thought was some approximation of the Pilgrims’ Way, not by the road but by footpaths carving through the fields until out here on the outskirts of some town that looked like an England that had imagined itself, listening to her sing what sounded to be a folksong, and I try to remember the words as best I can: ‘Run, little laddie, run; run, run on just a little farther…’</p>
