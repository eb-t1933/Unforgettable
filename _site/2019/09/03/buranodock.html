    <p>The dock in front of the graveyard in Burano, where I slept in the dark after running from two guys on a moped on the Lido; where I returned years later with a friend as the sky opened to the sun for a solitary hour between days of downpour; where I returned after yet more years and she napped and I gave over to remembering time.</p>
