    <p>The door was open and I was serving someone coffee when a pigeon, avoiding the glass wall panes along the length of the train station waiting room, flew in, hovered over each table in turn long enough to blow off the menus, then flew back out the narrow opening again unharmed, leaving only the customer saying: ‘When they fly inside, they almost never survive.’</p>
