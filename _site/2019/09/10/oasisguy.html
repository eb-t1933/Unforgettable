    <p>The drunk guy on the dock leading down from the Kings Arms who came up to me and my friends and gave a speech about how we couldn’t remember the release of “Live Forever” and that this was why society would never reach Mars that was so impassioned that he convinced everyone to jump directly into the Ouse for a swim, except for me, because I am no swimmer.</p>
