    <p>The stretch of Flatbush Ave out beyond Atlantic leading up to the bridge at night during the summer of 2019 as I sped downhill in the rushing wind on a bike avoiding multi-lane traffic, and the spires of the New Brooklyn that has risen up just in my time here brooded on the horizon like a catâ€™s claw looming, and I realized just how long half a decade is, and just how much that is too long.</p>
