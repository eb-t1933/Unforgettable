    <h1>A hostel on Hemenway Street</h1>

    <p>The hostel on Hemenway Street, so hard to find, was so safe, so huge, so full of people, so far preferable to the freezing far-sub-zero temperatures outside; I sat at its computer and found my future apartment on Craigslist; I hated it when I had to move for a couple days to a much worse hostel with showers even colder than the weather; I loved it as I returned on obscure nights, staring up into the whorl of snow, listening to the snatches of song escaping the surrounding buildings as music students played in the darkness.</p>
