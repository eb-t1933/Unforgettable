    <p>The couple in the Bayswater bay window stood framed by the ostentatiously artificial diorama setpiece of darkened houses either side and I stood outside too-perfect in my slack-jawed misery and my gray hoodie on my first night alone, having moved into the bedsit studio earlier in the day, and I lost myself to the reverie of spiteful wonder, and they, a moving van out front and the living room empty and her pointing to all the blank spaces excitedly one after the other, lost themselves to just a life, just life.</p>
