    </p>

    <p>The moment of happiness struck in a Boston T station on my way back from getting a new social security card at the appropriate government office, it must have been so I could start work at Legal Sea Foods; it must have been North Station, it was underground I remember: it must have been on the Green Line platform that happiness struck, and I started dancing to The Books’ ‘Take Time’ and realized my happiness and was able—incredible&amp;mdashto enjoy that, to grow my happiness further, because nothing was wrong.</p>
